# AdventOfCode 2023 Solutions
These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2023. I haven't really finished all of them yet... I might get back to the remaining ones a little later when I get some time. I have explained the thought process behind a few. For the remaining, best of luck figuring out the inconsistent variable naming.

All of these solutions have been written in python. A lot of hours have been spent on each of them. This is why I gave up fairly early. I promise I'll get back to it and wont let this be one of my abandoned projects.
